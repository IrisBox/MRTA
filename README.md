# Machine Reading the Archive (MRTA)
The primary aim of [Cambridge Digital Humanities'](https://www.cdh.cam.ac.uk/) [Machine Reading the Archive](https://www.cdh.cam.ac.uk/learning/learning-themes/mra) programme is to develop a deeper understanding of the challenges and possibilities of working with archival data in the digital age, drawing on theory, methods and practice from the humanities, computer science and the archival profession.

# Can automated image analysis improve accessibility? 
My MRTA project aims to explore the potential of image analysis to improve web accessability of the digitised content in [Cambridge Digital Library](https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/)

## Original Project Synopsis
I would like to explore the potential of automated image analysis to improve the accessibility of digitised archive collections. Using machine learning methods to extract data from images, focusing on four potential themes:
•	geometric shapes 
•	anthropomorphic or zoomorphic forms
•	colour and tone
•	similarity
In doing so, I aim to then explore if this data is suitable to be fed back into the images and act to enhance the experience of interacting with digital archives.

I also aim to demonstrate the potential and current limitations of these tools and methods for more advanced academic purposes through the case-study generated by this project.
